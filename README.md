Anthony Salazar Go project

This project written in golang is able to create, update, check and delete users and decks for the game Magic the gathering. The project takes the cards information from an external public API that contains all the cards information. This information is taken and add it to the deck under the specific user.

This project contains two workspaces (FE and BE) the frontend workspace contains the views and the models for all the project, also is the one that creates the requests for both APIs and the backend workspace contains all the controllers, contains the API created by me and also connects the API via to MySQL
